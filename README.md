I'm a computer science student in “Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles” (CPGE) at the Lycée Champollion.
I look forward to collaborating with you on all kinds of projects. Contact me there: skymix.code@outlook.com


I have an advanced level in Python/HTML/CSS/Ocaml.
I'm currently learning the basics of C.
