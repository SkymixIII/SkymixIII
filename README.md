I'm a computer science student in the “Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles” (CPGE) at the Lycée Champollion.
I look forward to collaborating with you on all kinds of projects. Contact me there: loisdg@outlook.fr


I have an advanced level in Python/HTML/CSS.
Advanced level in C.
I'm currently learning the basics of Ocaml (this language sucks).
